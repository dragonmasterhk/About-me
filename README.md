# About Me
Hi there! I am Howard Liu, a final-year financial journalism student from Hong Kong Baptist U. I was born in Beijing and raised there. Roughly 3 years ago, I came to Hong Kong for college, as I am a super fan of Hong Kong films. To be honest, journalism department was not my first choice. And I just happened to be in the journalism department. Fortunately, I found financial journalism interesting and decided to stay here. Since then, I worked for Xinhua Net, Caixin Global and Reuters as an intern, covering company stories in mainland China. Recently, I love watching the American cartoon series South Park. I have to say it's really a good one because the show always finds a way to be sarcastic and interesting at the same time. 

# Why I am here?
I enroll for this course simply because I want to learn some tools. I feel like if I have a basic knowledge of collecting data and presenting data, I will come up more ideas and ways to present stories to my audience some day in the future. And I will also pick up these tools real quick when I need them.

# Disciplines that I am interested in
* Global economy
* Policies
* Communication study
